      "Its evident that in the truth table of $p \\to q$   When $p$ is False and $q$ is True, Then $p \\to q$ is True.  But in some instances i could not convince myself about this truth value.  For example:  $p$: Quadrilateral is Cyclic  $q$: Opposite angles are supplementary  Now is $p$ is False and $q$ is True, how can $p \\to q$ can be True? \n",

      "I am self studying real analysis.I have come up with following proof and I know that other proofs exist. But, Can someone just tell me if there is anything wrong with the following proof.Thanks in advance     1.we will show that it satisfies cauchy criterion for series  2.consider arbitrary $\\epsilon &gt; 0$  3.since we know that $\\sum a_n$ converges absolutely  we know that there exists a N s.t forall $n &gt; m \\geq N$ s.t $|\\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} |a_k|| = \\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} |a_k| &lt; \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$  4.we know show that this N indeed suffices  5.consider arbitrary $n &gt; m \\geq N$  $|\\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k^2|  =  \\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} a_k^2 \\leq  (\\sum_{k=m+1}^{n} |a_k|)^2 &lt; \\sqrt{\\epsilon}^2 = \\epsilon$  6.so conclude that $\\sum a_n^2$ converges \n",

      "Prove that n squared is less than or equal to 2 to the n by induction.\n",
      "I've been asked to prove by induction that $n^2\\leq 2^n$, and told it is true $ \\forall n\\in \\mathbb{N},n&gt;3$   I think I have found the right way to the proof, but I'm not sure since I get stuck half-way there. What I did was taking a base case of $n=4$ and tested it, and it resulted to be true. Then I assumed it would be true for some number $k$, such that $n=k$ and $k^2\\leq 2^k$, and attempted to prove   $(k+1)^2 \\leq 2^{k+1}$  And this is how I attempted to prove this. First of all, I started with my assumption.  $=k^2\\leq 2^k$  $=2k^2\\leq2^{k+1}$  Then I tried to prove that $(k+1)^2 \\leq 2k^2$, for this would imply my thesis, i.e. $(k+1)^2\\leq2^{k+1}$. So I went forth on my effort:  $(k+1)^2≤2k^2$  $=k^2+2k+1\\leq2k^2$  $=2k+1\\leq k^2$  (By assumption)  $=2k+1\\leq 2^k$   Now that I simplified it, I need to prove this is true; this is, prove that $(k+1)^2 \\leq 2k^2$. So I take a base case of $n=4$ and in deed it satisfies the inequality. So I assume it is true for some number $j, k=j$ and try to prove it. Nevertheless I have failed in trying to prove this, I don't really know if my steps so far are right or wrong. Is my reasoning okay? And if its, how can I prove $2k+1\\leq 2^k$? Thank you in advance. \n",
