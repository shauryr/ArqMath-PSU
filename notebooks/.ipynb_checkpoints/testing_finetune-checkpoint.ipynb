For example take M0(x):â‰¡1 and M1(x):=(xâˆ’x0) (which happens to be the naive Vandermonde basis when x0=0 but consider that an accident). Look now for two coefficients, say c0,c1 such that the linear function c0M0+c1M1 interpolates f at x0,x1, you solve a linear system and you'll getc0=f(x0) and c1=f(x1)âˆ’f(x0)x1âˆ’x0.(Can you smell Newton's divided differences? Never mind, focus on Hermite for now.) So in fact, posing h=x1âˆ’x0 we see that the only quantity that depends on h is c1=c^1(h), while c0,M0,M1 are h-independent, so we have an h-dependent Lagrange interpolant L(h)(x)=c0M0(x)+c^1(h)M1(x). This is useful. Drums rolling, we let x1â†’x0 (or hâ†’0) and track the quantities that depend on h, i.e., c^1(h) which will simply converge to fâ€²(x0), hence the linear interpolant becomes\"\n"
